# Universal Memory Field

**Arithmetic Memory Field Theory (AMFT)** proposes that a scalar displacement field with memory organizes
structure across scales via a small set of preferred carrier modes (the “alphabet”). Particles, shells, and
band enrichments arise where resonance and memory align.

## Core Ideas

- **Memory Kernel → Carriers:** The Toeplitz memory kernel yields a small set of spectral carriers that act as
  the organizing frequencies of the field.
- **Carriers → Shells:** Shells (e.g., particle masses) form on harmonics of these carriers, following
  a calibrated scaling law \( m = C (n/f)^\alpha \).
- **Two-Mode Dynamics:** We observe two scaling regimes (\(\alpha_{\text{low}} \approx 1.25\) for accumulation;
  \(\alpha_{\text{high}} \lesssim 1.1\) for release), consistent with a universal “breathing” of the field.
- **Cross-Scale Coherence:** The same carriers and scaling principles appear from particle physics to astrophysical
  QPOs and galactic structures.
