    # Scaling Law and Two-Mode Dynamics

    We model shell masses as
    \[
      m = C \left(\frac{n}{f}\right)^{\alpha},
    \]
    where \(f\) is a carrier frequency from the memory kernel spectrum and \(n\) is the harmonic index.
    The data prefer a two-regime (piecewise) scaling with a breakpoint near the electroweak scale:
    \(\alpha_{\mathrm{low}} \approx 1.25\) for accumulation and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{high}} \lesssim 1.1\) for release.
